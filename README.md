ENEM101 Wind Mapping Assignment Brief 
Submission deadline:   Friday 22nd   November 2024,   12pm.
Submission format:   Electronic, via   ELE
This assignment   is worth 20% of the overall module   mark.
Outline: Wind turbine development opportunities in the Roseland peninsula The mapping exercise is an initial analysis to identify potential wind energy development   sites in the Roseland peninsula by considering the wind energy potential and   development constraints for different turbine sizes. This will involve mapping the area in   QGIS   and   evaluating   all   the   relevant   constraints   on   turbine   locations.   Please   include   reasonable   amount   of   detail   in   textboxes   as   your   submission   will   be   used   as   a   stand-   alone presentation of your findings for local discussion and consultation.The   objectives   of this   assignment   are:   a)   Demonstrate your ability to   make   use   of GIS   software   b)   Demonstrate   knowledge   of   relevant   wind   farm   development   parameters   (constraints/buffers/mitigation).
Background An   active    local   energy   group   are    keen   to    understand    the    potential   for   wind    in   the   Roseland   peninsula. The   Neighbourhood   Development   Plan (NDP) is on the   ELE   page   and this shows the included   parishes and planning framework.
For a   parish of your choice   in the   Roseland   Peninsula, you   may   recommend   new   sites   for development and/or suggest the re-powering/extension of existing projects.You will prepare up to Four A3-sized maps of   the relevant area. This will include a main   map   up   to   A3   size*;   and   at   least   one   inset   map**; and   a   table   of   the   sites   you   have   identified***.   Further insets may be used   if you feel they   are   appropriate   and/or   useful.Ensure that the title   block   of your   map   contains title,   date,   and   STUDENT   NUMBER   -   NOT YOUR NAME. Ideally, within the title block area, an additional   table of notes should   be   included that   indicates the sources of data used   in   preparing the map   and   table.
Note that all maps should   be accompanied   by a   legend,   a   suitable   scale,   a   North   arrow   and any relevant   copyright   notice.*The maps will show i) all the candidate/potential sites; ii) polygons   indicating the   extent   of   designated/constrained areas restricting development;   iii) site boundaries; iv) relevant   geographic   information   (locations   of   towns,   the   road   and   power   distribution   networks   etc.); and v) your table of candidate sites   (See   below ***).**This   inset   map   -   approximately A5/A4   size   -   will   give   the   detailed   local   constraints   affecting your preferred site. It will also include turbine location information and potential   access tracks etc.***Produce a list/table of prospective sites (maximum of 10)   -   numbered   and   giving   site   name, 12 figure e.g.   E123456  N987654 site centre location,   wind speed  other useful   information- that meet the site suitability   criteria.
Site suitability 
1)       Wind speed.   Not less than   7.5   m/s at   45   m   above   ground   level.
2)       Site   access.   Site   entrances   should   be   no   more than   500   metres from   the   public   road   network (including   minor roads).
3)       Proximity to electrical distribution (33kV)   networks   (within   5   km).
4)       Microwave   links. The turbine(s)   should   not   stand   within   the   buffer   zone   of   an   existing   microwave communication link.
5)       Urban areas.   For ≤   12MW,   turbines   should   be   at   least   5 x   Tip-height   from   the   nearest   non-financially   involved   dwelling   to   minimise   disturbance   by turbine   noise   or   shadow   flicker. For >12MW, turbines should beat least 6 x Tip-height from the nearest dwelling   non-fina代 写ENEM101 Wind Mapping Assignment BriefMatlab

6)       Watercourses. The sites should have a clearance of 50m from any mapped river, lake,   stream, or other watercourses.
7)       You should apply relevant buffers to   any   sensitive features   you   identify.
8)       Environmental criteria. You should clarify   if your sites   impinge   on   any   of the following:
a.    Areas of Outstanding   Natural   Beauty 
b.      National Parks
c.      Sites of Special Scientific   Interest
d.      Special Protected Areas
e.      Special Areas of Conservation
f.         National Nature   Reserves
g.      Local   Nature   Reserves
h.      RAMSARS (International wetlands designation)
i.         World   Heritage Sites
j.         Scheduled Monuments
k.      Heritage Coasts
9)       Aspect:   By visual   interpretation   of the   OS   maps or   use   of QGIS   -   the   location   should,   preferably,   be   approximately   facing   the   South-West   compass   'quadrant'   since   the   prevailing wind direction   is assumed to   be from the south-west.
10)   Slope: By   visual interpretation of   the OS maps use of   QGIS   -   the slope of   the site should   be   less than   15 degrees for construction considerations.
11)   By visual interpretation of Google Earth aerial images, confirm there are no constraints   affecting your main chosen site that have not   appeared   on   OS   maps.
Use   NOABL   data   for   the   wind   speeds.   Strategi,   Meridian   and   Land-line/Mastermap,   Digimap products contain vector road   network data.You may use the previously supplied QGIS   tables as a guide   for   the electrical distribution   network and microwave   links.   Use   OS   maps of appropriate scales for   the   backgrounds   to your finished maps.QGIS   tables are available to model most of   these environmental criteria on ELE. Natural   England   has   on-line   up-to-date   constraint   data   in   QGIS format.   Data for the   remaining   criteria lie within the Edina Digimap products.   If you wish to edit some of these datasets   you will   need to   re-save them under an alternative   name   before you are   able to   do   so.
Assessment Submission Procedure Your final   printout   is   intended to   be as clear   and   informative   as   possible.   There   can   be   issues   in   converting   your   on-screen   finished   map   layout   to   a   PDF   file   -   loss   of   image   quality or the computer might seize-up -   because   of the   potential   file   size   and   the   PDF   print software version you   have.   Resolution of the   images should   be at   least   300   dpi.
You must follow the instructions regarding the   hand-in and ensure   your file is   suitable for   printing.
•         The   hand-in must   be anonymous
•          Image quality should be maintained when exporting a PDF file for electronic hand   in.   Please check the   images   before submitting the assignment
